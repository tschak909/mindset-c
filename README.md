mindset-c
=========

Here you will find bindings for the very rare Mindset computer, which are intended to be used with OpenWatcom-C for creating new programs.

The MINDSET Software Development Guide is provided as a canonical reference, and with the exception of adding convenience unions and structs,
the data from the developers guide can be used verbatim.

A copy of the Developers guide is included in doc/ for reference.
